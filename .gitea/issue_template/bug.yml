        Use a debug build of river if possible to get a better quality
        stacktrace in the case of a crash:
        ```
        zig build -Doptimize=Debug <other desired options>
        ```

        Set the log level to debug and redirect river's stderr to a file:
        ```
        river -log-level debug 2> river.log
        ```
        Reproduce your problem and exit river.

        If the issue is with a specific Wayland client (e.g. firefox) a log of the
        Wayland protocol messages between the client and river is often very helpful.
        Obtain one by setting WAYLAND_DEBUG=1 and redirecting stderr to a file.
        ```
        WAYLAND_DEBUG=1 firefox 2> firefox.log
        ```
